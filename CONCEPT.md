# Decentralized GPU Network for Neural Network Training

## Project Concept
A peer-to-peer network that allows individuals to rent out their unused GPU resources for neural network training tasks, receiving cryptocurrency payments in return. The system functions similarly to how blockchain nodes operate but focuses specifically on distributing machine learning workloads.

## Core Features

### For GPU Providers
- **Passive Income Generation**: Monetize idle GPU resources
- **Flexible Participation**: Choose when to make resources available
- **Privacy-Focused**: Integration with privacy-centric cryptocurrencies like Monero
- **Resource Controls**: Set limits on GPU usage, temperature thresholds, and energy consumption
- **Simple Setup**: Easy installation via GitHub with minimal configuration

### For AI Developers
- **Cost-Effective Computing**: Access distributed GPU resources at competitive rates
- **Scalable Resources**: Dynamically scale computing needs without hardware investment
- **Democratized Access**: Lower barriers to entry for AI research and development
- **Resilient Infrastructure**: Tasks distributed across multiple nodes for reliability

## Technical Architecture

### Components
1. **Client Application**
   - GPU resource detection and monitoring
   - Workload execution environment
   - Wallet integration for receiving payments
   - Local job queue management

2. **Coordination Layer**
   - Job distribution algorithm
   - Work verification system
   - Payment processing
   - Network health monitoring

3. **Smart Contracts**
